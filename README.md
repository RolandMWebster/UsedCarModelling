# UsedCarModelling
In this repository we perform a full EDA of some Used Car Data from the below link. We then use random forest and xgboost models to predict car prices.

We're back to using R for this project. I wanted to focus more on EDA techniques without getting caught up with syntax issues so I went back to what I know best.
